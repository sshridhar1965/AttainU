What happens when we enter www.google.com ?

When we enter www.google.com , following things happen -

A request is sent from the browser to DNS ( Domain Name Server ) to fetch the IP address of Google.com.
DNS maintains a mapping of IP address v/s domain names like Google.com.
Computer doesn't understand the domain names , it only understands IP addresses.Domain names are only for Human understanding.
So once the DNS fetches the IP address , the website like Google.com is displayed to the user as this is the site running on that 
IP address.

IETF ( Internet Engg task force ) is the nodal agency controlling this mapping of Domain names and IP addresses.
